## Legacy Releases

AIVA was known as Jarvis in version 2. It is now deprecated, but if you need to reference stuff from Jarvis, do `git checkout tags/v2.0` or checkout [the releases](https://github.com/kengz/aiva/releases).

AIVA v3 was last released at [v3.2.1](https://github.com/kengz/aiva/releases/tag/v3.2.1), which was full featured, but quite heavy. We retire it in favor of a lighter, more developer-friendly and extendible version.
